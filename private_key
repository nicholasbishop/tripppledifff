"What else can I be," returned the uncle, "when I live in such a world
of fools as this?  Merry Christmas!  Out upon merry Christmas!  What's
Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a
time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time
for balancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round
dozen of months presented dead against you?  If I could work my will,"
said Scrooge indignantly, "every idiot who goes about with 'Merry
Christmas' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and
buried with a stake of holly through his heart.  He should!"
